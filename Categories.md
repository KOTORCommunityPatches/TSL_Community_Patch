## 2. Enhancements
Things in this category are intended to enhance the game experience. This might mean restoring cut content, improving aesthetic consistency, addressing anything that seemed out of place, or just getting rid of things that annoyed some people. These changes may go a little beyond developer intent, but they only utilize existing game assets.

## 3. And the Rest
This category is for anything else that didn't make the cut for 1 or 2. Any modder-created content goes here. It might also be something that just isn't as popular, or there may be some technical compatibility concern. We don't really know the criteria yet.
