## 1. Description:
This mod is a compilation of various bugfix mods put together with the intention of fixing all the known bugs with the last official patch of KOTOR 2. A huge thanks to all of the mod authors who created these mods, and gave me permission to include them in this patch.

## 2. Install:
Run INSTALL.exe and navigate to your K2 install folder. Generally speaking, this mod should be installed before anything else, except mods that do hard edits/overwrites of 2DA, TLK or MOD (module) files.

## 3. Uninstall:
Given the complexity of this mod, a clean install of KOTOR II is recommended. However, you can check through the installation log file if you wish to undo the changes made.
