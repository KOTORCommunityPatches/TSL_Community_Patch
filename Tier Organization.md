# Tier 1

## Bug Fixes
These are the most critical fixes. If a bug is on this list, it isn't just a minor annoyance, but actually prevents you from playing the game the way it was meant to be played * restricting access to content, making it impossible to complete quests, and so on.


## Developer Oversight
These are fixes for other issues that were likely unintended. They don't break the game, but they are obvious things to fix.
* A number of items have wrong descriptions or properties: [Marauder Fix Pack 1.0.3](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/942-marauder-fix-pack/)

# Tier 2
## Atmospheric/Lore/Logical Changes
The issues these address aren't exactly problems, but they still bothered people. Changes in this category go a bit beyond developer intent, basically player/modder interpretation of how things should have been.

## Annoyance Fixes
These things annoyed players.
* Running in outer space makes you look like a squirrel injected with caffeine

# Tier 3
## Visual Improvements
Sometimes the game assets aren't great. These changes correct problems with them, and may require modder-created assets. But the changes are minimal; they just make the game look how it ought to look.
* A number of textures don't use shaders: [Textures Improvement Project](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/462-textures-improvement-project/)

* The Zeison Sha armour for males (PMBMM) is unable to properly perform a two-handed grip during weapon animations: [Get a Grip! Zeison Sha Armour Male Model Fix 1.0](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1362-get-a-grip-zeison-sha-armour-male-model-fix/)
* The walking and running animations are janky: [Movement Animation Fix for Both KOTOR and TSL](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/465-movement-animation-fix-for-both-kotor-and-tsl/)

## Ported Content
Everything here involves content ported from another game.

## Gameplay Tweaks
These changes affect the gameplay, adjusting it to function how it was intended, or at least however the KOTOR community has deemed to be fairer than what was intended.
